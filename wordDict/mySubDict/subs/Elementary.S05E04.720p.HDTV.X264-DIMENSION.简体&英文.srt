00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,710
你有十秒钟解释清楚这些
You got about ten seconds to reach a point with this

17
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,840
否则这水就要扣你头上了
before this water ends up on your head.

18
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,320
描述一下我刚放在柜子上的图
Describe the image I just put on the cabinet over there.

19
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,730
而我不能动吗
And I'm not allowed to move?

20
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,150
你可以  但是记住
You can, but remember

21
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,140
恩奎斯先生特别说了
Mr. Enriquez specifically stated

22
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,170
他当时带着酒钵走向演奏台
that he was walking the punch bowl to the band shell,

23
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,670
就在他要放下时
about to set it thereupon,

24
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,190
他听到了枪声
at the moment he heard the gunshots.

25
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,230
另外记住  地上没有洒出来的酒
Also remember there was no evidence of spilled sangria--

26
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,710
如果有人像你这样  突然转身
as would happen if someone in your position abruptly turned--

27
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,970
现场就该有洒出来的酒
found at the scene.

28
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,600
恩奎斯不可能看见开枪的人
There's no way Enriquez saw the shooter.

29
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,110
他的证词是假的
His statement's a lie.

30
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,900
觉得他是在替谁打掩护吗
Think he's covering for someone?

31
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,810
如果你说的「谁」是指他自己的话
If by "someone" you mean "himself."

32
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,480
在你调查的过程中  你发现
In the course of your investigation you discovered

33
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,080
被害人是个被通缉的野生动物贩子
that the victim was a wanted wildlife trafficker.

34
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,740
特别是  被通缉的原因是从厄瓜多尔
Wanted, most notably, for smuggling

35
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,200
走私珍稀动物加拉帕戈斯鬣蜥
rare Galápagos iguanas out of Ecuador.

36
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,020
恩奎斯先生来自厄瓜多尔
Mr. Enriquez is from Ecuador.

37
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,380
在这些案发当天的照片中  
And in these photographs, from the day of the murder,

38
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,370
我看到他手臂上有多处伤痕
I saw multiple scars on his arms

39
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,850
符合加拉帕戈斯鬣蜥的咬痕
consistent with those of Galápagos iguana bites.

40
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,220
相信我  我知道自己在说什么
Trust me when I say I know of what I speak.

41
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,430
你认为这是生意上的争执
You think this was some kind of business dispute?

42
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,290
我认为鉴于恩奎斯先生的假供词
I think that in light of Mr. Enriquez's false statement

43
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,990
值得再查查他
he's worth a second look.

44
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,970
一个便便的表情
A poop emoji?

45
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,970
我以为那是冰淇凌
Oh, I thought it was ice cream.

46
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,930
那是副局长普罗斯基吧
That's Deputy Chief Prosky, isn't it?

47
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,770
是他
That's him.

48
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,210
他是警监的上司吧
He's the captain's boss, isn't he?

49
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,140
有什么问题吗
Is there a... Problem?

50
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,800
实际上  他是警监的上司的上司
Technically, he's the captain's boss' boss,

51
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,280
也就是我的上司的上司的上司
which means he's my boss' boss' boss,

52
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,000
还意味着我决定不多管闲事
which means I'm gonna mind my own business.

53
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,790
但多谢了  现在我知道你觉得有地方不对
But thanks, now that I know you think something's wrong,

54
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,300
我也会开始担心了  我去把这个倒了
I'm gonna be worrying, too. I'm gonna go spill this out.

55
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,300
你最好在普罗斯基看到前  拿走你的「冰淇凌」
You should take down your "ice cream" before Prosky sees it.

56
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,640
不不不  我不要冷静
No, no, no, no, I'm not calming down!

57
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,640
我们的地方被毁了
Our place is trashed!

58
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,950
伦恩  声音小点  让她说
Len, keep your voice down. Let her talk.

59
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,160
我们会处理所有的事  我保证
We'll take care of everything, I promise.

60
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,770
合同里都写了
It's in your contract.

61
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,300
我说过我们不需要房客
I told you we did not need renters, okay?

62
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,550
我们花钱是找人看家的
We should have paid for a house sitter.

63
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,070
空房乐租为这种情况上了保险
AwayKay carries insurance for just such situations.

64
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,470
我们介绍的客人造成了这些损害
Guests we paired you with did all this damage,

65
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,420
-因此我们会负责全部赔偿  -真的吗
- so we'll cover all the costs. - Oh, really?

66
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,600
看见这地毯没  这是古董
You see this rug? It's an antique.

67
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,310
他们会为它赔我五万美金吗
Are they gonna give me 50 grand for it?

68
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,080
不会  我也是这么想的  我要报警了
No, that's what I thought. Look, I'm calling the cops,

69
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,650
这是肆意破坏他人财产
because this is vandalism.

70
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,930
空房乐租和公司章程冲突  咱们会被开除
AwayKaying is against the co-op charter. They could throw us out.

71
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,190
-你早就知道  -房租每月过万啊  伦恩
- And you knew that? - It was 11 grand a month, Len.

72
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,680
什么东西
Now, what the hell?

73
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,030
这是什么鬼  壁炉棍子  还是什么
What the hell is this, a fireplace poker or something?

74
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,260
他们在这里干了什么
What were they doing in here?

75
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,840
等等  在你把那东西拿出来前
Wait, before you pull that out,

76
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,390
先让我给保险那边照张相
let me get a photo for the insurance.

77
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,670
它还挺牢
That's in there pretty tight.

78
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,970
伦恩  你够了吧
Len, will you stop it?

79
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,770
-墙要碎了  -亲爱的  能帮我拿工具吗
You're gonna break the wall. Now, honey, could you get my tools?

80
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,580
那里面到底有什么啊
What is in there?

81
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,000
你不能把它拔出墙  所以...
You're not getting that out of the wall, so...

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,890
伦恩  住手
Len, stop it!

83
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,110
住手  求你了
Stop it, please.

84
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,720
福尔摩斯：演绎法

85
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,720
第五季  第四集

86
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,870
我很确定那些案子都解决了
Pretty sure we solved all those cases.

87
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,580
没错  是解决了
You are right, we did.

88
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,470
所以这往事重温是什么意思
So, why the trip down memory lane?

89
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,430
昨晚我在局里的时候  我发现警监
Last night while I was at the precinct I observed the captain

90
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,120
跟他的上司在关着门开会
in a closed-door meeting with a superior officer.

91
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,780
我看到他们在重新过一些结案的案子
I could see they were reviewing a number of closed cases.

92
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,940
我去档案室查了下被取出的档案
I checked the file room to see which files had been pulled,

93
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,930
看看  是咱们的案子
and voilà-- our cases.

94
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,750
或者说  是不少咱们的案子
Or, rather, a curious number of them.

95
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,840
好吧
Okay.

96
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,120
我很想知道
I'm attempting to determine

97
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,690
他们为什么在看这些档案
why they were looking at these particular files

98
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,100
以及他们在讨论什么
and what they were discussing.

99
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,890
咱们又遇上麻烦了吗  还是内务部
Are we in hot water again? Has Internal Affairs

100
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,620
再一次把它严格的目光投向了我们
turned its Orwellian eye on us once more?

101
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,780
如果真是如此呢
So what if they have?

102
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,370
咱们以前经历过这种事
We've weathered the storm before.

103
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,760
我们最近又没有违反什么规定
It's not like we've broken any rules lately.

104
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,740
-没比以往违规的次数多  -确实如此
- Well, any more than usual. - It's true.

105
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,870
但你难道不想知道我们遇上了什么
But wouldn't you rather know what kind of attack

106
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,810
需要自己抵挡的攻击吗
we have to defend ourselves against?

107
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,610
也可能什么事都没有
It could also be nothing.

108
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,280
怎么可能没事
How could it be nothing?

109
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,140
它们不在档案室
Just because those weren't in the file room

110
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,780
并不意味着它们就是警监他们在看的
doesn't mean that they're the ones that they're looking at.

111
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,410
不管怎么回事  警监会支持我们
And whatever it is, the captain's got our back.

112
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,850
如果这事他觉得咱们该知道
So if it's something he thinks that we need to know,

113
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,160
他会告诉咱们
he'll tell us.

114
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,080
我要做早饭了  你吃什么吗
I'm gonna make some breakfast. Do you want anything?

115
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,220
是马库斯
It's Marcus.

116
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,220
喂
Hello?

117
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,100
好的  我们马上过去
Yes, we'll be right there.

118
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,680
起码我们刚知道了  我们还没被禁用
Well, at least we know we haven't been benched just yet.

119
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,470
做点能带在路上吃的早餐吧  华生
Make it breakfast to go, Watson.

120
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,280
被害人叫罗素·科尔
Victim's name is Russell Cole.

121
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,950
这间公寓是他的  临时工发现的他
He owned this apartment. Super found him.

122
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,010
科尔先生在巴瑞特·怀特公司工作
Mr. Cole worked for Barrett White Capital,

123
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,290
一家投资公司
an investment firm.

124
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,070
他是一位定量分析师  搞数学的
He was a quant-- quantitative analyst. Deep math guy.

125
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,490
他们用复杂的公式分析公司
They use complicated formulas to analyze companies

126
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,660
然后作出投资建议
and then make investment recommendations.

127
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,290
没有闯入痕迹
No sign of forced entry.

128
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,200
但是看起来有过打斗
Looks like there was a struggle, though.

129
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,920
所以没人看到或听到什么
So, no one saw or heard anything.

130
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,790
隔壁的人把房子租给了吵闹的空房租客
Well, the folks next door had some noisy AwayKayers.

131
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,390
他们搬走了
They'd moved on,

132
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,920
但其他邻居不知道
but the other neighbors didn't know that,

133
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,100
所以额外的打砸声被忽略了
so a few extra crashes and bangs were just ignored.

134
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,180
再说所有人都以为科尔出城了
Plus everyone thought Cole was out of town.

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,030
他们说已经几周没见过他了
They said they hadn't seen him in weeks.

136
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,280
门口的行李包里都是衣服
Overnight bag by the door is full of clothes.

137
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,720
他肯定是刚回家
He must have just come home.

138
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,860
不管怎样  不会有人计划用壁炉火钩
Anyway, nobody shows up planning to commit a murder

139
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,220
实施谋杀的
with a fireplace poker,

140
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,920
所以我觉得这不是预谋好的
so I'm thinking this wasn't premeditated.

141
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,380
科尔让这个人进了门
Cole let the person in,

142
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,750
也许他们互相认识  出于一些原因
so maybe they knew each other and for whatever reason,

143
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,130
情况失控了
things turned ugly.

144
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,520
你错了
You're incorrect.

145
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,730
关于没有预谋这点
About it not being premeditated.

146
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,200
凶手是带着这个来的
The killer came armed with this.

147
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,200
枪把手有纹理  也许很难提取指纹
It's a textured grip, so it might be hard to get prints,

148
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,980
但值得一试
but it's worth a try.

149
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,710
杂志没有放好
Magazine isn't seated properly.

150
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,570
凶器可能是没能开火
That weapon would have failed to fire.

151
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,410
你怎么知道要看那下面
Well, how'd you know to look under there?

152
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,180
如你所说  没人会计划这样实施谋杀
As you said, no one plans to commit a murder this way,

153
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,360
但犯罪的明确性表示这是计划好的
and yet the specificity of the crime suggests it was planned.

154
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,250
这就提出了另一种可能性
And that raises another possible scenario:

155
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,290
凶手是带着凶器来的
the killer came better armed.

156
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,010
发生打斗之后 他或她被缴械了
A fight ensued, he or she was disarmed

157
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,320
然后拿起火钳完成了谋杀
before grabbing the poker to finish the job.

158
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,470
什么明确性
What specificity?

159
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,890
袭击发生的时间
Timing of the attack.

160
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,760
就在科尔先生回家的时候
Just as Mr. Cole gets home.

161
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,110
再加上看起来唯一失踪的东西
Plus the fact that, by appearances,

162
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,560
就是他的笔记本电脑
the only other thing missing is his laptop.

163
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,890
这个包上都是灰  被太阳晒褪色了
This bag is dusty, bleached by the sun,

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,670
除了这个区域
apart from this area here.

165
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,640
这个包有一个可移动电脑套
Now, this bag comes with a removable laptop sleeve.

166
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,590
它就在这里  所以如果电脑不见了
It sits right there. So, if his laptop is missing,

167
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,450
也许是被凶手拿走了
perhaps the killer has it.

168
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,300
我们还没找到它
Well, we haven't found it yet.

169
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,910
警监想让我过去聊几句
Captain wants me to stop by for a word,

170
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,330
就像一个人什么都不想讨论时一样
as one does when one wants to discuss nothing.

171
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,900
科尔是华尔街的分析师
Cole was a Wall Street analyst.

172
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,500
他电脑里可能有很多值得杀人的东西
His laptop could have contained a lot of things worth killing over--

173
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,190
内部信息  金融犯罪的证据
insider information, proof of a financial crime.

174
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,090
你去跟警监谈
Well, you go talk to the captain,

175
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,240
我们去科尔的办公室
we'll go to Cole's office,

176
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,360
看看能不能查出他在做什么
see if we can find out what he was working on.

177
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,970
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

178
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,530
这太可怕了
This is horrible.

179
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,990
你跟科尔先生很熟吗
Were you and Mr. Cole close?

180
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,180
罗素不光是为我工作
Oh, Russell didn't just work for me.

181
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,940
他是我的家人
He was family.

182
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,020
他一毕业就来这里工作了
He started here right out of school.

183
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,790
你能想到任何
Can you think of any reason

184
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,420
会让人想杀他的原因吗
someone might have wanted to kill him?

185
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,300
人们经常会对我们不满
I... I mean, people get angry at us all the time.

186
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,500
威胁我们
Threaten us.

187
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,680
如果我们给一家公司评级很低  数百万就没了
We give a company a poor rating, millions of dollars disappear.

188
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,520
但没有这样的情况
But... nothing like this.

189
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,530
罗素最近的工作有没有可能
Was there anything that Russell was working on in particular

190
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,080
让他受到威胁
that might have aroused threats?

191
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,400
抱歉  你们看起来很肯定他是因工作而死
I'm sorry, you seem pretty sure he was killed because of work.

192
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,650
有理由吗
Is there a reason?

193
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,330
我们觉得他的电脑被人拿走了
We think a laptop was taken from his apartment.

194
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,930
也许凶手就是为了
Could be whatever he had on it

195
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,510
电脑里面的东西
is what the person was after.

196
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,180
其实
Well, the truth is

197
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,430
我完全不知道他在做什么
I have no idea what he was working on.

198
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,340
罗素的专长是科技  医药  信息技术  航空
Russell specialized in tech, medicine, I.T., aerospace,

199
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,790
但关于他目前在做什么  我...
but as to what he was into at any given moment, I...

200
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,220
他是我的疯狂天才
He was my mad genius.

201
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,130
他会独自披荆斩棘
He'd beat the bushes on his own,

202
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,310
寻求其他人看不到的机会
look for opportunities no one else saw.

203
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,920
去隐秘的地方
Go off somewhere private,

204
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,960
深入挖掘一家公司的数据
deep dive into a company's numbers.

205
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,740
我给他很大的权限
I gave him a long leash

206
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,320
因为他总能带回金子
because he always came back with gold.

207
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,080
他前几周是不是去挖掘数据了
Was he on one of these deep dives the last few weeks?

208
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,100
他的邻居说他一直不在家
His neighbors said he hadn't been home.

209
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,870
你知道他去哪了吗
Any idea where he went?

210
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,920
不知道
No clue.

211
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,890
我妻子一定会很伤心
Oh. My wife is gonna be devastated.

212
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,710
那是她吗
Is that her?

213
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,850
劳丽  她在某个慈善活动中赢了毛伊岛之旅
Laurie. She won a trip to Maui in some charity thing.

214
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,200
她带了一个女性朋友去
She took a girlfriend.

215
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,850
我想尽我所能帮忙  你们需要什么
I want to help any way I can. What do you need?

216
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,360
我们想检查一下科尔先生的办公室
Well, we'd like to go through Mr. Cole's office,

217
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,340
看看能不能查出他在做什么
see if can figure out what he's been working on.

218
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,950
我们还想看看他的电子邮件和信件
We'd also like access to his e-mails and correspondence

219
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,500
看看有没有人威胁他
so we could look for any threats.

220
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,300
我亲自带你们过去
I'll walk you over there myself.

221
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,260
进来
Come in.

222
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,960
坐吧
Sit down.

223
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,930
我该担心吗
Should I be concerned?

224
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,800
放松  我觉得你昨晚肯定察觉到了
Relax. I had a hunch you picked up a vibe last night

225
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,480
我不希望你一直乱想
and I didn't want you in your head about it.

226
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,650
你昨晚看到的会面  不是你想的那样
The meeting that you saw-- it wasn't, uh, what you think.

227
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,370
我还没决定好该怎么想  但请继续
Well, I haven't decided what I think, but go on.

228
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,990
你听说过表彰日吗
Did you ever hear of, uh, Medal Day?

229
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,880
纽约警局的年度传统
Annual NYPD tradition.

230
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,790
市长和警长为英勇杰出的警官
The, uh, mayor and the police commissioner give out medals

231
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,020
颁发奖章
to officers for valor, distinguished service.

232
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,170
还有会给因公负伤的警察
Not to mention purple shields

233
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,370
颁发紫盾
for those injured in the line of duty.

234
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,740
他们还会给做出模范工作的小队
They also give out something called a unit citation

235
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,380
颁发一种叫小组嘉奖的东西
to squads that have done exemplary work,

236
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,970
今年他们准备给重案组一个
and this year they're giving one out to Major Case.

237
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,340
典礼过几天举行
The ceremony's in a few days.

238
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,660
这是你们应得的  恭喜
Well, that's well deserved. Congratulations.

239
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,240
我没有告诉你和乔恩
I wasn't gonna say anything to you and Joan

240
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,960
是因为这事还不确定
because it still might not happen,

241
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,130
但平民顾问是包括在奖项里的
but civilian employees are included in the award,

242
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,990
我想把你的名字也放到名单里
and I want your names on the list.

243
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,750
没有钱什么的
It isn't money or anything,

244
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,420
你只是会被写入警局的官方记录
you'd just be part of the department's official record

245
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,240
然后每人获得一个奖状
and you'd each get a certificate.

246
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,780
可以用来装饰墙壁
Something to hang on the wall.

247
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,860
我知道了
I see.

248
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,540
我受到了一些阻力
I have been getting some resistance.

249
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,440
我想应该告诉你
I thought you should know about it.

250
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,920
巴瑞特夫人
Mrs. Barrett.

251
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,250
我无意惊吓您  我是乔恩·华生
I don't mean to startle you. I'm Joan Watson.

252
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,770
我是警方的顾问
I work with the police.

253
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,090
我在调查罗素·科尔谋杀案
I'm investigating the murder of Russell Cole.

254
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,590
是的  我丈夫告诉我了
Yes, my husband told me.

255
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,400
你丈夫办公室有张你在烤猪野宴上的照片
Your husband has a photo in his office of you at a luau.

256
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,010
我注意到镜头一角被什么东西挡住了
I noticed there was something blocking the lens in one corner.

257
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,770
我大概知道那是什么  所以我查了查
I had an idea what it was, so I looked into it.

258
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,070
照片是用罗素的手机拍的
That picture was taken on Russell's phone.

259
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,530
他的手机壳破了
His case was broken,

260
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,640
塑料碎片凸出来挡住了镜头
and a piece of plastic was sticking out over the camera.

261
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,140
警方本以为那是在谋杀过程中被损坏的
Police thought it had been damaged during the murder.

262
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,320
但我记起在他家里看到一张照片
But then I remembered seeing a picture at his place

263
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,330
上面有着同样的异物
with the same obstruction.

264
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,760
所以那手机壳已经破了一段时间了
So the case had been broken for some time.

265
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,220
罗素就是你带去毛伊岛的那个朋友
Russell was the friend you took to Maui.

266
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,490
你们俩有婚外情
You were having an affair.

267
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,700
而鉴于你丈夫还留着旅行的纪念品
And considering your husband has a memento from the trip,

268
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,070
我猜他还不知道
I'm guessing he doesn't know.

269
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,480
对  他不知道
No, he-he doesn't.

270
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,370
我发誓  罗素的事和我没关系
And I swear, I had nothing to do with what happened to Russell.

271
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,600
我非常伤心
I'm a wreck about it.

272
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,520
目前你并不是嫌疑人
Right now you're not a suspect.

273
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,850
但我需要你提供些信息
But I need some information from you

274
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,960
我们正在试图找出
We're trying to find out

275
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,130
罗素最近几周待在了哪里
where Russell had been staying the last few weeks.

276
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,400
警察检查了他的车和他的信用卡
Police checked his car and his credit cards.

277
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,080
他们确定他没有开车出城太远
They're pretty sure that he didn't drive too far outside the city.

278
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,140
你和他去过毛伊岛
Now, you went all the way to Maui with him.

279
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,560
所以我想也许他带你去过他
So I thought maybe he'd taken you to the place

280
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,250
玩"深潜"的地方
where he does his deep dives.

281
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,630
他有一个...
He has a...

282
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,690
小屋  在熊山附近
a cabin near Bear Mountain.

283
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,540
往北部一小时的路程
It's about an hour upstate.

284
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,620
这周围有大量的毒藤
Copious amounts of poison ivy around.

285
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,800
看着点路
Watch your step.

286
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,550
你是怎么比我们先到的
How'd you get here before us?

287
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,040
你应该记得我认识一家直升飞机公司的老板
You'll recall I know the owner of a helicopter company.

288
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,660
有一架要飞向这边
There was one going this way.

289
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,970
我就搭了个顺风机
I hitched a ride.

290
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,970
-你进去过了吗  -没有
- You been inside? - No.

291
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,830
我刚到这里没多久
I just got here a short while ago.

292
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,910
这里吸引我关注的东西挺多的
Plenty to keep me occupied out here.

293
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,180
那么  只有一辆车最近留下了轮胎印
So, only one vehicle has left recent tire tracks.

294
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,120
胎面与罗素·科尔的吻合
The tread matches that of Russell Cole's.

295
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,050
同样的  最近的足迹也是他的
And, likewise, the only recent footprints are his.

296
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,640
所以他的确来过这里  并且他没有访客
So he was here, and he didn't have any visitors.

297
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,290
看来他不想把生意和享乐混在一起
Guess he didn't like mixing business with pleasure.

298
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,580
我是说  除了睡老板的老婆
I mean, besides sleeping with the boss' wife.

299
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,770
我不是专家  但这看起来不是金融资料
I'm no expert, but this doesn't look financial.

300
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,970
更像是科学
More like science.

301
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,710
是关于质量和半径
Stuff about masses and radii

302
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,400
还有反射系数的
and reflection coefficients.

303
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,010
你说得对
You're right.

304
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,070
这些是物理公式
These are physics equations.

305
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,860
其实是天文学
Astronomy, to be exact.

306
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,240
好吧  所以科尔是来这里看星星的
Okay, so Cole was up here stargazing.

307
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,530
这些和华尔街有什么关系
What does any of this have to do with Wall Street?

308
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,190
很难说
That's difficult to say.

309
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,780
但我想我知道他是为什么被杀的了
But I do think I understand what he was killed over.

310
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,790
没什么比地球上生命的未来更重要
Nothing less than the fate of life on Earth.

311
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,290
所以  这些点都是小行星
So, all these dots are asteroids?

312
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,920
它们的近似点  没错
An approximation of them, yes.

313
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
当然  不是所有现存的小行星
Not all asteroids in existence, of course.

314
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,850
显然的  它们数以万亿计
Obviously, there are hundreds of millions of those.

315
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,170
这里有五千个左右
These are the 5,000 or so

316
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,970
是航天局定性为有危险性的
that NASA has deemed potentially hazardous,

317
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,940
它们的轨道和地球的轨道相交
those whose orbits intersect with the Earth's

318
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,820
因此有着导致大灾难的可能性
and therefore pose a threat of cataclysmic collision.

319
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,570
同样的碰撞曾灭绝了恐龙
Such a collision wiped out the dinosaurs,

320
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,500
以及同时期大部分其他生物
along with most other life at the time.

321
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,670
这里任何一个点都能导致那样的事件
Any one of these dots could represent the next such event,

322
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,510
也将是人类历史上最后一个事件
which would be the last event in human history.

323
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,590
但那里只有五千个
But there are only 5,000 of them,

324
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,860
还挺让人放心的
so that's reassuring.

325
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,890
重点在于"可能"的大灾难
Emphasis on "potentially" hazardous.

326
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,140
但是坐稳了  因为你肚子里感觉到的
But brace yourself, because that existential knot of terror

327
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,950
那股存在主义恐惧感将会更加强烈
you're feeling in your stomach is about to grow tighter.

328
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,610
一星期前  科尔提了篇论文给个科学博客
A week ago, Cole submitted a paper to a science blog,

329
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,210
说他相信我们看待
saying that he believed the whole way

330
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,050
小行星的方式是错的
we're looking for asteroids is wrong.

331
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,590
「对近地球小行星的错误计算
"Miscalculating Near-Earth Asteroids

332
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,680
以及人类灭亡危机」
and the Threat to Human Existence"?

333
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,730
他写到科学家在过去几年
He wrote that scientists have detected thousands of

334
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,130
发现了上千个新的小行星
new asteroids in the last few years.

335
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,620
但据他说
But according to him,

336
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,020
我们对它们大小的测量完全错误
our measurements of their sizes are useless.

337
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,420
当涉及到保护人类种族
And when it comes to protecting the human race

338
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,050
不被大冲撞毁灭  显然大小很重要
from an extinction-level impact, obviously size matters.

339
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,440
只知道小行星在那是不够的
It's not just enough to know that an asteroid is there.

340
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,590
我们还需要知道哪一个是大个的
We need to know which ones are the big ones.

341
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,220
然后呢  叫布鲁斯·威利斯去炸了吗
So that, what, Bruce Willis can go nuke it?

342
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,220
{\an9}电影《绝世天劫》的梗

343
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,340
出奇的  没错  我们今天看到了
Surprisingly, yes. We've been reading up

344
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,340
这篇文章  有份请求中的提案
on this stuff today-- there are proposals in the works

345
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,320
想送火箭上小行星
to send rockets to asteroids,

346
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,530
去推动甚至炸掉它们
to nudge them or even blow them up.

347
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,030
那科尔说得对吗
So was Cole right?

348
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,700
测量方法真的不正确吗
Are we measuring them wrong?

349
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,810
不知道
No idea.

350
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,090
我们知道这个在华尔街工作的人
Do we have any idea why a Wall Street guy

351
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,090
为什么要研究这事吗
was studying this stuff in the first place?

352
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,030
-不知道  -那我们现在有什么结论
- We don't. - So where does all this put us?

353
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,760
你们好像都不确定他是因为这事被杀的
Sounds like you're not even sure this is what got him killed,

354
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,220
更不用说具体原因了
let alone why.

355
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,540
论文里的技术细节超出了我的知识范围
The technical minutiae of the paper are beyond my expertise.

356
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,140
我有些看不懂
I'm at something of a loss.

357
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,330
-但是  -有个这方面的专家
- But...? - Well, there's an expert

358
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,380
我有时会向他请教
in the field I consult from time to time.

359
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,280
不过这一般不是我的首选项
But doing so is never really my first choice.

360
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,630
那我帮你做决定  去找他
Well, I'm gonna make it easy for you. Do it.

361
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,230
而且这不光是为了破谋杀案
And not just to solve this murder.

362
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,380
如果世界真要灭亡了
If the world is coming to an end,

363
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
我想提前知道
I want to know about it.

364
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,150
{\an9}纽约科学中心
朱利斯·肯特  宇宙大使

365
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,860
科学家估计我们的宇宙
We scientists estimate that our universe

366
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,340
已经有一百四十亿年了
is 14 billion years old.

367
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,960
想知道我们是怎么估计的吗
Ever wonder how we know?

368
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,800
其实  有很多方法
Actually, in a number of ways.

369
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,370
其中一种方法是测量残余的辐射
One of them is by measuring the radiation that's left over...

370
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,590
朱利斯·肯特  宇宙大使
Julius Kent, Ambassador to the Cosmos.

371
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,770
{\an9}纽约科学中心
朱利斯·肯特  宇宙大使

372
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,800
-他经常上电视  是个名人  -是的
- He's on TV all the time. He's famous. - Yep.

373
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,880
著名的天文学家  因为很显然
Celebrity astronomer. Because apparently the world

374
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,610
人们需要用通俗的话来理解科学
needs science explained to it with jazz hands.

375
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,910
我们以前是寄宿学校的同学
We were at boarding school together.

376
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,800
他当时和现在一样很能吹
He was every bit the blowhard then that he is now.

377
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,990
十年前  他帮我计算了太阳耀斑的时间
Ten years ago, he helped me time a break-in to coincide

378
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,850
好让我闯入到一个地方
with a solar flare.

379
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,940
无线电干扰可以使探测器探测不到我
The radio interference enabled me to avoid detection.

380
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,180
-干得很漂亮  -那你为什么不愿意找他
- It was good. - So why didn't you want to call him?

381
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,580
因为每次找他帮忙的时候  他都会沾沾自喜
Because every time I ask for his help, he gloats.

382
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,560
你跟格雷森谈得怎么样
Oh, how did that conversation with Gregson go?

383
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,530
-我们又被开除了吗  -恰恰相反
- Are we fired again? - The opposite, of sorts.

384
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,960
重案组要获得嘉奖
The Major Case Squad is receiving a commendation,

385
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,250
他在努力把我们也加入到名单中
and he's lobbying to have us included.

386
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,970
由于官方报告上都没有我们的名字
Thanks to our habit of keeping our names out

387
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,010
即使有也把我们的贡献说得很小
of official reports, or at least minimizing our roles,

388
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,540
所以他很难说服荣誉委员会的人
he's having trouble convincing the honor committee.

389
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,490
无论结果怎样
Well, however it goes down,

390
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,760
他愿意替我们出头就很让人感动
it's nice that he's sticking his neck out for us.

391
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,860
我倒是希望他不这么做
I'd rather he didn't.

392
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,850
你知道我不喜欢这种嘉奖  华生
I eschew such recognition, Watson. You know that.

393
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,610
我跟警监说了  可他不听
I've reminded the captain of such, but he's persisting.

394
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,130
-所以我就用了其他方法  -其他方法
- So I initiated other steps. - Other steps?

395
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,210
你知道还能怎么做吗  你可以说声谢谢就好
You know what you could do? You could just say thank you,

396
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,690
正常人都会这么做
like a normal human being.

397
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,180
夏洛克
Sherlock.

398
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,430
这位一定就是乔恩了
And this must be Joan.

399
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,990
很荣幸见到你  夏洛克从没说过
It's a pleasure. Sherlock never said

400
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,670
你们俩是朋友
that you two knew each other.

401
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,060
是的  我不感到意外
Yes. I'm not surprised.

402
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,590
认识我好像让他很掉价似的
My very existence seems to embarrass him.

403
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,480
要是没有我的话  我们的这位朋友
You know, if it weren't for me, our friend Sherlock

404
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,680
还以为太阳是绕着地球转呢
would still think that the Sun revolves around the Earth.

405
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,000
我犯这个错的时候才八岁
I was eight when I made that mistake.

406
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,220
可你现在竟然还穿这种马甲
You chose to wear that vest this morning.

407
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,780
这是粉丝送的
It was a gift from a fan.

408
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,720
我怎么能拒绝呢
How could I resist?

409
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,050
你有自尊啊
With self-respect.

410
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,140
罗素·科尔和他的小行星警告
So, Russell Cole and his Asteroid Admonition.

411
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,170
夏洛克说你已经看过他的论文了
Sherlock said that you were already aware of his paper?

412
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,970
在我们的圈子了激起了不小的风波
It made quite a splash in my circles.

413
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,120
来吧  我解释给你们听
Come, I'll explain it to you.

414
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,130
当然了  用大白话
In layman's terms, of course.

415
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,160
简单来说
So, in a nutshell,

416
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,320
小行星是由太阳提供热量
asteroids are warmed by the Sun.

417
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,320
用常规方法我们很难观察它们
They're very hard to see by conventional means,

418
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,210
所以我们通过红外线来寻找它们的热量
so instead we look for their heat, using infrared.

419
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,200
理论上来说  我们可以分辨出
And, theoretically, we can tell the difference

420
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,160
大小不同的热物体
between a large warm object and a small one,

421
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,190
也就是小行星的大小
i.e., the size of the asteroid.

422
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,310
目前还能听懂
Makes sense so far.

423
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,160
但是根据罗素·科尔的说法
But according to Russell Cole,

424
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,770
这种方法是无效的  因为没有考虑组成
this fails to take into account what the asteroids

425
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,710
小行星的物质成分  主要是碳
are actually made of. Some are mostly carbon,

426
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,720
还有铁  甚至还含有铂和金
others more iron, many even contain platinum and gold.

427
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,630
也就是说有的小行星外表是暗的
Which means that some asteroids have dull, dark surfaces

428
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,580
而另一些是亮的
and others have light, shiny ones.

429
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,330
我相信就连夏洛克都能
And I'm sure even Sherlock can tell us

430
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,870
说出这会有什么影响
the effect that that would have.

431
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,340
深色的表面会吸收更多的热量
Dark surfaces get hotter than light ones.

432
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,310
所以  如果他是正确的
Which, if Cole is right,

433
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,930
也就意味着我们测量小行星大小的方法全错了
means that we've been seeing asteroid sizes all wrong.

434
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,790
那他正确吗
Was he right?

435
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,120
没人知道
No one knows.

436
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,410
科尔是个优秀的数学家
Cole was a fine mathematician,

437
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,160
但天体物理学不是他的专业
but astrophysics wasn't really his field.

438
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,670
他的论文里有很多错误
His paper was rife with errors

439
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,380
而且有些工作还没完成
and incomplete work.

440
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,960
我们圈子要花几个月的时间才能得出结论
It'll take the community months to reach a consensus.

441
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,320
当然  我会提供帮助
I'll help, of course.

442
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,300
这世界真是多亏了有你
The world will sleep easier.

443
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,600
科尔在论文里说他正在研究一个解决方案
Cole mentioned in his paper that he was working on a solution.

444
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,970
你能想出有什么人想要阻止他吗
Can you think of anyone who would want to stop him?

445
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,620
很容易啊  那些依靠用现有方法
Well, naturally. Anyone whose livelihood depends on

446
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,070
测量小行星大小吃饭的人
the current methods of determining asteroid size.

447
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,180
因为科尔的论文
Because of Cole's paper,

448
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,450
美国宇航局已经搁置了一项提案
NASA's already shelved one proposal.

449
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,190
一个名为皮亚齐的绕轨道运行的红外线望远镜
An orbiting infrared telescope called Piazzi.

450
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,700
而许多小设备会从
And much of the equipment would have been bought

451
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,610
小型私人公司那里采购
from small private companies.

452
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,170
这些公司会失去他们的主要收入来源
Those companies have just lost their prime source of income.

453
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,980
可能跟他们有关系的人很生气  杀了科尔
Maybe someone associated with them killed Cole in anger.

454
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,020
这项目能有多少钱
So how much money are we talking about?

455
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,650
皮亚齐项目的总共预算吗
The total budget for Piazzi?

456
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,570
大约五亿美元
Around $500 million.

457
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,060
你以前真的以为太阳绕着地球转吗
You really thought the Sun revolved around the Earth?

458
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,090
我当时才八岁
I was eight.

459
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,210
是马库斯
It's Marcus.

460
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,730
我们都在这
Hey. We're both here.

461
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,110
刚看到留言说有一通电话
Just got a message about a call that came in.

462
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,030
新城餐馆的一名女服务生在新闻里认出了科尔
A waitress up in New City recognized Cole on the news.

463
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,860
说他在过去的几周
Said he was in her diner a bunch of times

464
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,470
去了她的餐馆几次
over the last few weeks.

465
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,080
从他的小屋过去喝咖啡也太远了吧
That's a long drive from his cabin for coffee, no?

466
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,620
在这里和熊山的中间
It's halfway between here and Bear Mountain.

467
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,170
或许他去见什么人
Maybe he was meeting someone?

468
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,500
也只能这么怀疑了
That's as good a guess as any.

469
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,140
她跟接电话的警探说
All she told the detective who talked to her

470
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,730
她觉得科尔举止很奇怪
was she thought Cole behaved strangely.

471
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,770
我觉得有必要开车去看看
I figure it's worth a drive to check it out.

472
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,410
华生马上跟你一起去
Watson will join you presently.

473
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,080
-只有我吗  -一个可能看到了
- Just me? - A waitress who may

474
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,790
科尔离开小屋去吃饭的女服务员
have seen Cole leave his cabin for meals--

475
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,260
我俩都去可能有点多余
both of us checking that out seems a little excessive.

476
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,890
由于朱利斯  我们现在有了确凿的动机
Thanks to Julius, we now have a concrete theory of motive.

477
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,130
皮亚齐项目流产导致了很多公司亏损百万
A dozen companies lost millions upon the death of Piazzi.

478
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,400
我们中的一个应该留下来调查这些公司
One of us should stay behind and start combing through them.

479
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,970
你可以在车里工作的
You could work in the car, you know.

480
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,100
我在城里还有件事要办
I also have an appointment to keep here in the city.

481
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,690
就是他
That's him.

482
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,560
每两三天就来一次
Came in once every two or three days,

483
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,470
总在午餐和晚餐之间
always right between lunch and dinner.

484
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,570
你有见过他在这里见什么人吗
Did you ever see him meet with anyone while he was here?

485
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,950
他总是一个人吃饭  没跟别人说过话
He always ate alone, didn't talk to anyone.

486
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,540
你打来的时候说有些奇怪的行为
When you called, you mentioned some kind of strange behavior.

487
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,960
能说说是什么意思吗
Can you tell us what you meant?

488
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,100
可能没什么
It might be nothing.

489
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,870
但我看新闻说他被杀了
But I saw he was murdered.

490
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,200
你知道新闻里总说的
And you know what the news always says--

491
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,190
看到任何事都要说
see something, say something.

492
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,670
他总带着电脑  但他在这里从来不用
He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it in here.

493
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,830
他吃完就会拿到停车场里
After he'd eat, he'd take it out there to the parking lot.

494
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,730
在那里用一会电脑
He'd do a little work on it,

495
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,710
就站在那墙边
just standing over there, by the wall,

496
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,820
然后开车离开
and then get in his car and go.

497
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,030
顾客总在这里工作  我们也很支持
Customers work in here all the time. We encourage it.

498
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,780
为什么他要走到外面
Why'd he need to go outside?

499
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,870
可能科尔在找无线信号
Maybe Cole was looking for a Wi-Fi signal.

500
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,160
可能是在黑入某个公司
Could have been hacking into a business,

501
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,110
可能那栋楼里的一家
maybe one inside this building.

502
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,460
我觉得不是
I don't think that's it.

503
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,350
这是U盘吗
Is that a thumb drive?

504
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,480
看上去有人凿了一个洞
Looks like someone drilled a hole

505
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,640
以便他们埋在墙里
so they could bury it in the mortar.

506
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,620
我觉得这是个秘密情报传送点
I think it's a dead drop.

507
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,170
我以前看到过  这样双方就能
I've seen it done like this before. It's so two parties

508
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,350
在网上不留痕迹地交换数据
can exchange data without leaving a trail online.

509
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,910
科尔应该不是来找信号的
I don't think Cole was out here looking for a signal.

510
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,450
他是把电脑插入这里
I think he was plugging his laptop into that

511
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,030
上传下载信息
to get information on and off of it.

512
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,870
我的车里有工具
I think I've got some tools in my car.

513
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,870
感谢你来见我
Thank you for seeing me.

514
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,100
我该称你为「普罗斯基副局长」
Do I address you by the full "Deputy Chief Prosky"?

515
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,120
-还是「普罗斯基局长」  -拜托
- or just "Chief Prosky"? - Come on.

516
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,520
有了汤米·格雷森说的你和你的搭档的那些事迹
After all Tommy Gregson has told me about you and your partner,

517
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,290
你怎么称呼我都行
you can call me anything you want.

518
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,710
我能如何帮你
What can I do for you?

519
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,300
我想跟你谈谈
Um, I'd like to talk to you

520
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,360
关于你跟格雷森警监之间的谈话
about your conversations with Captain Gregson,

521
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,800
还有表彰日的事
and about Medal Day.

522
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,680
-说吧  -首先
- Fire away. - Well, first of all,

523
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,190
我想说我对于警方
I would like to say, that, uh, I have the greatest respect

524
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,030
有着崇高的敬意  而对其服务的表彰
for the men and women in blue, and commendations for service

525
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,010
我也决不会视同儿戏
are not something I take lightly.

526
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,000
无可争议
No argument here.

527
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,680
但是
But, um...

528
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,140
如果你不介意的话  福尔摩斯先生
...if you don't mind, Mr. Holmes, uh,

529
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,900
容我插嘴一句
let me jump in here.

530
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,060
听起来你知道
It sounds like you know that

531
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,330
汤米让我们处境尴尬
Tommy has put us in a tough spot.

532
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,930
在正常情况下
Now, under perfect circumstances,

533
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,390
把你加入「小组嘉奖」是
including you in a Unit Citation would be, uh...

534
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,470
不正规的
Well, unorthodox.

535
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,440
除此之外  你和华生女士
And on top of that, you and Ms. Watson

536
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,690
还有一些争议
have had your share of, uh, controversy,

537
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,090
至少这么说
to say the least.

538
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,440
然而荣誉委员会
The Honor Committee

539
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,060
并不是要拒绝
is not saying no, yet,

540
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,090
只是我们可能没法表彰你们
but we may not be able to square it.

541
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,280
你听到我要说的话应该会如释重负的
I think you'll be relieved by what I have to say.

542
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,560
我希望退出你们的考量范围
Respectfully, I'd like to bow out of consideration.

543
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,350
我试图劝服警监
I tried to persuade the captain

544
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,970
撤销他的请求  但无果
to rescind his request, but, uh, to no avail.

545
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,180
所以我整理了一张细则表
So instead, I, um, I've compiled a list of technicalities,

546
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,500
我觉得警局能加以利用
which, I think, the department could invoke.

547
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,390
其中任何一条
Any one of them

548
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,910
都能逼警监撤回申请
should compel the captain to withdraw,

549
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,840
既能让我不用参与其中
whilst keeping me out of it,

550
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,270
也能让你告诉他你尽力了
and allowing you to tell him that you did your best.

551
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,980
天啊
Uh, boy...

552
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,390
你和你的搭档得商量好你们到底想怎样
You and your partner need to get straight what it is you want.

553
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,100
您什么意思
I beg your pardon?

554
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,150
你的搭档
Your partner.

555
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,310
她来这里的时候对此很积极
She was all for it when she was in here.

556
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,490
-我的搭档  -没错
- My partner. - Yeah.

557
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,790
-她来过这里  -没错
- Was here. - Yeah.

558
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,130
你们在U盘上找到的就是这些了吗
This is everything you found on the thumb drive?

559
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,250
这些消息  还有多份罗素·科尔论文草稿
These messages, plus multiple drafts of Russell Cole's paper.

560
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,720
他不是自己写的  他有个帮手帮他
He didn't write it by himself, he had a partner who helped.

561
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,380
他们逐字逐句商量了所有的细节
They went over every detail together, word by word.

562
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,130
这个帮手的名字呢
This partner have a name?

563
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,470
他们交流的时候不用名字
They didn't use names when they communicated,

564
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,000
也说得通  他们已经用了情报秘密传递点
which makes sense, they were already using a dead drop

565
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,880
来保密他们的合作
to keep their partnership a secret.

566
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,150
我不明白的是
Here's what I don't get.

567
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,170
你跟一个说这篇论文
You talked to someone who said

568
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,220
漏洞百出的人谈过
that that paper was full of sloppy work.

569
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,930
而我们却现在发现有两个人
Now, we find out two people

570
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,550
非常仔细地检查过这文章
went over it with a fine-tooth comb.

571
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,250
问题就在这  由此看来
Well, that's the thing, it looks like

572
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,730
那些错误都是故意写出来的
all these mistakes were deliberate.

573
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,020
他们想让相关领域专家
They wanted it to take months

574
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,670
花费数月时间来解决疑问
for experts in the field to untangle.

575
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,020
这篇文章就是故意写来搞垮皮亚齐观测计划的
The paper was designed to kill the Piazzi telescope project.

576
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,410
就是那个价值五亿美元的计划
The one that's worth half a billion dollars.

577
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,470
科尔的同伙就是背后的煽动者
Cole's partner was the instigator.

578
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,560
他许诺出大价钱让科尔发表文章
He promised to pay Cole big time for publishing the paper.

579
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,670
但你看最后几条信息
But check out the last couple of messages.

580
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,130
{\an9}两倍太多了  但我明白你的意思了
我们可以再商量  你可以回来了
周一晚七点  你公寓

581
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,290
他要加价
He was upping the price.

582
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,120
科尔想要更多的钱
Cole wanted more money.

583
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,750
他同伙答应可以商量
The partner agreed to talk about it,

584
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,580
并让他回到城里来
and told him to come back into the city.

585
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,540
他们打算两天前夜里在科尔的公寓见面
They were gonna meet at Cole's apartment two nights ago.

586
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,440
就是科尔被杀的那晚
The night Cole was murdered.

587
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,220
我们之前以为科尔的文章伤到了什么人
We've been thinking someone who was hurt

588
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,930
这个人出于愤怒杀死了科尔
by Cole's paper killed him in anger,

589
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,300
但由此来看  他可能
but it turns out, he may have been killed

590
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,410
死在雇他写文章的人手里
by whoever hired him to write it.

591
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,580
你们这儿的人都是这么办事的吗
Is this how you people conduct your business?

592
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,410
居然骗一个全力配合的人
You lie to someone who does nothing but cooperate.

593
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,640
-假借名义把我骗到这里  -我们说的是
- Lure me here under false pretenses. - We told you

594
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,490
我们对案子有疑问  我们现在就在提出疑问
we had some questions about the case, we're asking them.

595
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,640
你可没说我是嫌疑人
You didn't tell me I was a suspect.

596
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,140
我把罗素当成兄弟
I loved Russell like a brother.

597
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,350
我怎么会杀他
Why would I have killed him?

598
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,060
科尔发表文章的目的
The paper Cole published was hand-crafted

599
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,650
是为了搞垮某个宇航局计划
to kill a NASA project.

600
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,430
这会给很多私人企业造成上百万损失
It cost multiple private companies millions.

601
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,290
我们认为这是市场操控
We think it was market manipulation.

602
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,280
你说过  你的数量化投资能搞垮一家公司
You said yourself how your quants can destroy a company,

603
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,310
并且你所处的位置恰好可以跟科尔共谋
and you were in the perfect position to conspire with Cole.

604
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,070
根据我们的研究  被攻击目标可能是
Based on our research, the likely target

605
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,570
一家叫天鹅座光学设备公司的望远镜生产商
was a telescope manufacturer named Cygnus Optics.

606
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,590
他们的估值
Their value's plummeted

607
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,590
由于皮亚齐观测计划的搁置而下滑
as a result of the shelving of the Piazzi project,

608
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,570
从而出现了完美的投资机会
creating an ideal investment opportunity.

609
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,320
所以你就抓住了这个机会
One that you have taken advantage of.

610
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,920
{\an9}证监会表格
股权收买证书

611
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,480
你知道这家公司的经济基础稳固
Knowing the company to be fundamentally sound,

612
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,060
你也敢肯定它的估值一定会恢复
you'll be confident that its value will recover.

613
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,170
文章发表后
Once the paper was published,

614
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,810
你让科尔低调行事
you told Cole to lie low.

615
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,760
你让他待在自己的小屋里
You wanted him to stay in his cabin,

616
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,140
应该是要找解决方案
supposedly working on a solution,

617
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,250
这样他就不会在危害发生时
so that he would be unavailable

618
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,950
接受别人的采访了
to answer questions while the damage took hold.

619
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,580
可后来科尔变得贪婪了
Then Cole got greedy.

620
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,230
想要更多的分成
Asked for a bigger cut.

621
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,150
你让他回到自己公寓来  你就在那杀了他
Told him to come back to his apartment, where you killed him.

622
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,850
你拿走了他的电脑  这样就不会有人发现
You took his laptop, so no one would find

623
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,750
你们俩之间的通信往来
the messages you'd been trading.

624
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,750
我们觉得你最终也会铲掉
And we figure you would have picked up the thumb drive

625
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,340
新城餐馆墙上的闪存口  可谁知道呢
in New City eventually, but who knows?

626
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,830
它隐藏地那么好
It was well hidden.

627
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,260
你可能觉得不会被人发现
Probably, you just figured no one would find it.

628
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,120
你们说对了一件事
You're right about one thing.

629
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,520
我投资了天鹅座光学设备公司
I invested in Cygnus Optics.

630
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,660
都暴跌成那样了
You would have, too,

631
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,360
换你  你也会投资的
after the nosedive it took.

632
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,800
但我完全不知道罗素写假文章的事
But I didn't know anything about Russell writing a phony paper.

633
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,690
他是周一晚上被杀的吧  几点
He was killed on Monday night, right? What time?

634
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,230
法医推断在七点至九点之间
M.E. puts it between 7:00 and 9:00.

635
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,660
我当时正在吃晚餐
I had a dinner.

636
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,110
商量新公司首轮公开募股的事
We were going over a new IPO.

637
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,060
十几个人都能帮我证明
A dozen witnesses can put me there.

638
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,310
我说我在意罗素
You don't believe me

639
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,260
你们并不相信我
when I say I cared about Russell.

640
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,060
你们觉得我只在乎钱
You think I only care about money.

641
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,510
那好  我们就来聊聊钱
So fine, let's talk about money.

642
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,410
我之前说过  他是我的摇钱树
I told you before, he was my golden goose.

643
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,840
你们看看过去八年的年度报告
Look at my annual reports over the last eight years.

644
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,020
在证监会就能查到
They're all on file with the SEC.

645
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,240
你们就知道他对我来说有多大价值了
Count up how much money he was worth to me over time.

646
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,440
你们说罗素想让同伙给他两倍价钱
You said Russell wanted his partner to pay him double?

647
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,020
我愿意出价十倍  二十倍
I would have given him ten times what he was asking... 20.

648
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,530
完全不是问题
It would have been easy.

649
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,760
你们想逮捕我  好啊
You want to arrest me? Fine.

650
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,940
但你们最后肯定会自取其辱
But you're gonna embarrass yourselves.

651
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,410
你们抓错人了
You've got the wrong guy.

652
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,210
-放走了科尔的老板  -暂时而已
- Cutting Cole's boss loose? - For now.

653
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,740
我们没有一小时前对他那么感兴趣了
We're not liking him as much as we did an hour ago.

654
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,220
他提供了不在场证明  我去核实一下
He gave us an alibi, I'm gonna check it out.

655
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,770
你们现在仍然觉得这事的目的
Are we still thinking this is all about tanking

656
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,380
是为了搞垮一家天文设备公司吗
a telescope company?

657
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,210
天鹅座光学设备公司仍然是最有可能的原因
Cygnus Optics is still our best theory,

658
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,220
但如果米其·巴瑞特与此无关
but if Mitch Barrett didn't have anything to do with it,

659
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,490
我们就要找出其他想要破坏这家公司的人
we have to find out who else had reason to hurt them.

660
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,160
这五亿的损失
One project's $500 million loss

661
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,720
可能会落入别人腰包
could be another's gain.

662
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,340
在调查朱利斯·肯特
Now, whilst researching the information

663
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,620
提供的信息时
that Julius Kent gave us,

664
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,890
我找到了一位
I identified somebody who could speak to

665
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,290
能对所有在审的小行星探索计划
all the asteroid-hunting projects

666
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,580
负责的人...
in consideration...

667
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,040
女议员克莉丝汀·萨拉查
Congresswoman Kristen Salazar,

668
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,850
纽约第31区的
from New York's 31st District.

669
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,010
她是白宫空间和科学基金会的
She sits on the House subcommittee

670
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,240
小组成员
for space and science funding.

671
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,310
我发现她这一周都在她曼哈顿的办公室里
Turns out she's in her Manhattan office all this week.

672
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,240
你想跟她谈谈
You're thinking talk to her,

673
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,540
看是否能找到别的嫌疑人
see if any other suspects jump out.

674
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,520
今天早些时候
When I attempted to contact her

675
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,670
我多次尝试跟她取得联系
several times earlier in the day,

676
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,820
可她却没有回复
my calls went unreturned.

677
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,310
因此我请朱利斯用他的名人效应试试看
So I asked Julius to try and leverage his celebrity,

678
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,900
看能否得到她的注意
see if he could get her attention.

679
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,480
她果然抽空把会面时间安排在了
And she made space in her schedule

680
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,980
明天一早
first thing tomorrow.

681
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,010
抱歉让你们久等了
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

682
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,310
我刚刚在打电话
I was on a call.

683
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,470
这儿一向乱糟糟的
It's always a madhouse around here.

684
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,500
没关系
Of course.

685
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,750
看来你们已经见过我的科学顾问了  格兰特
I see you've already met my science advisor, Grant,

686
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,350
他在这些方面是专家
which is good because he's the expert on all this.

687
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,680
大家请坐
Everyone, please.

688
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,720
你们应该听说了我们正在调查
I'm sure you heard that we are investigating

689
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,340
-罗素·科尔的谋杀案  -当然
- the murder of Russell Cole? - Of course.

690
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,550
他的文章让我们被迫将皮亚齐束之高阁了
He wrote the paper that forced us to mothball Piazzi.

691
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,970
太不幸了
It's simply tragic.

692
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,180
无论科尔的断言是对是错
And whether his assertions turn out to be right or wrong,

693
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,570
他显然天资过人
clearly Mr. Cole had a singular mind.

694
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,710
你们可能没察觉到
In ways that you may be unaware.

695
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,160
我们有证据证明
We've discovered evidence that

696
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,460
科尔先生是故意暗中破坏皮亚齐的
Mr. Cole undermined Piazzi... intentionally.

697
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,680
所以我们想知道谁能从他的行为中获益
So we'd like to know who profits from his actions.

698
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,360
我不明白
I don't understand.

699
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,060
你是说我们被摆了一道吗
Are you saying we were played?

700
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,510
可以这么说
In so many words.

701
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,410
那笔本应属于皮亚齐项目的五亿资金
The $500 million that would have gone to Piazzi,

702
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,780
会被重新分配给其他项目吗
is it going to be allocated to a different project?

703
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,510
不会  那笔钱哪都不会去
No, no, the money doesn't go anywhere,

704
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,580
不会被重新分配
it just doesn't get allocated.

705
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,200
我觉得你们忽略了大局
But I think you're missing the bigger picture.

706
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,980
那篇文章对所有小行星探索项目都造成了冲击
That paper hurt all asteroid-hunting projects equally.

707
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,330
当然  有些竞争项目
Obviously, there are competing projects

708
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,020
肯定想快人一步
that would have loved to cut ahead,

709
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,730
但这都是基于同一个前提的
but they all rely on the same principles

710
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,570
那就是受到了科尔文章的影响
that Cole's paper attacked.

711
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,830
他们都没有考虑
They all failed to take into account

712
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,500
小行星的成分
what asteroids are made of.

713
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,050
根据他的文章  所有人都在犯同一个错误
According to his paper, everyone is making the same mistake,

714
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,570
因此所有拟定项目都被无限期推迟了
so all proposed projects are on an indefinite hold.

715
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,890
如果你说的是真的
I mean, if what you're saying is true,

716
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,490
罗素·科尔做出的事就是灾难性的
Russell Cole has done something catastrophic.

717
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,380
不管他的动机是什么
Whatever his motives,

718
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,440
他的文章提出了真实合理的问题
his paper raised real, legitimate questions.

719
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,880
我们现在无法重新启动
We can't un-ring that bell now.

720
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,380
得等同业互查结束
We've gotta let the peer review play out.

721
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,820
政府资金也不是那么容易拿到的
And government funding doesn't come easily,

722
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,990
尤其是太空研究
especially not for space research.

723
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,370
即便专家断定他是错的
Even if the experts decide that he was wrong,

724
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,260
要让小行星研究重回正轨也要近十年
it could take a decade to get asteroid research back on track.

725
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,510
在思索宇宙的种种奥秘吗
Contemplating the mysteries of the universe?

726
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,000
只是一种奥秘
Just one, actually.

727
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,880
我对这个案子有了新的理论
I've developed a new theory of the crime,

728
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,580
而且我越来越喜欢这个理论了
which I'm liking more and more.

729
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,260
你身上为什么一股香蕉松饼的味道
Why do you smell like a banana muffin?

730
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,940
燕麦粥糊
Oh, its a paste of oatmeal,

731
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,300
小苏打  香蕉皮还有黄莲根
baking soda, banana peel, and goldenseal root.

732
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,880
自制止痒药
It's a homemade anti-itch remedy.

733
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,300
我好像起疹子了
I seem to be developing a rash.

734
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,100
你在科尔的小屋那边
Well, you must have touched some poison ivy

735
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,200
肯定碰到了什么有毒的常春藤
when you were up at Cole's cabin.

736
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,660
肯定没有
I most certainly did not.

737
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,670
我们到那儿之前你在小屋外面查看来着
You were walking around outside before we arrived.

738
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,410
我应该是你见过的最顶尖的
I'm the foremost expert on poisonous plants

739
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,450
有毒植物专家
you'll likely ever meet.

740
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,380
我没有碰毒藤
I did not touch poison ivy.

741
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,030
燕麦粥作何解释
Proof is in the oatmeal.

742
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,560
那你的理论是什么
So what's your theory?

743
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,930
离开萨拉查议员女士的办公室后
Since leaving Congresswoman Salazar's office,

744
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,160
我一直在想她和胡贝尔先生告诉我们的事
I've been thinking about what she and Mr. Huber told us.

745
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,330
科尔发表的文章
That the effect of Cole's paper

746
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,210
能够将寻找小行星的研究
was to delay the hunt for asteroids

747
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,890
推迟十年
for as much as a decade.

748
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,800
我开始考虑会不会目的就在于此
I started wondering if that was the point.

749
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,920
所以你觉得有人想让我们
So you think someone wants us all to be killed

750
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,440
都被一块大石头杀死吗
by a giant rock?

751
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,280
我的理论不止于此
My theory is much more out there,

752
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,270
可以这么说
so to speak.

753
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,580
洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

754
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,870
如果对寻找小行星有害的事
What if what was bad for asteroid hunting

755
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,320
对开采小行星有益呢
was good for asteroid mining?

756
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,510
什么
Excuse me?

757
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,080
这些石头上有金子  华生
There's gold in them there rocks, Watson.

758
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,130
还有铂金  很多  正如朱利斯所说
Platinum, too. Lots of it. Just as Julius said.

759
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,550
是的  但在大概2020年之前
Yeah, but nobody's gonna be able to fly a ship

760
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,270
没人能把飞船开上小行星
to an asteroid until sometime in the 2020s.

761
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,460
这是我理论的关键部分  过来
A crucial element to my theory. Come on.

762
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,210
迈克尔·海恩斯  金航执行总裁
"Michael Hines, CEO Aurum Aeronautics.

763
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,590
芭芭拉·托雷西  外部动力执行总裁
Barbara Torrissi, CEO Exterral Dynamics."

764
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,300
大家被科尔文章影响的程度不是一样的吗
I thought everyone was hurt equally by Cole's paper.

765
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,930
我不那么认为了
I no longer think that's true.

766
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,030
这四家公司加起来
Combined, those four companies

767
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,940
投资了数十亿资金
are investing billions towards

768
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,550
在小行星采矿勘察的长期研究上
the long-term prospects for asteroid mining.

769
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,710
各国政府也在注资
The world's governments are also investing

770
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,070
研究小行星
in missions to asteroids,

771
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,390
这大大降低了这些公司的资金压力
which greatly reduces the cost to those companies.

772
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,190
然而政府
Governments, however--

773
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,440
他们只是出于害怕小行星撞击地球
they're driven only by their fear of asteroid impact.

774
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,410
例如美国宇航局  只关心拯救人类
NASA, for example, cares only about saving the human race,

775
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,530
而不是开发稀有金属
not about mining for rare metals.

776
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,770
事实上  我们目前
And the truth is the chances that anything really bad

777
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:32,060
被撞击的可能性非常小
is going to hit us anytime soon is infinitesimal.

778
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,350
上次灭绝级的撞击是在660万年前
The last extinction-level impact was 66 million years ago.

779
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,700
即便是地区性的毁灭
Even an event that would be locally devastating--

780
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,170
比如一座城市
the loss of a city, for example--

781
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,160
也是5000年一遇
that only comes along every 5,000 years.

782
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,350
相比之下  十年毫无意义
Decade here or there, meaningless.

783
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,480
所以你认为专家们标记小行星的速度太快了
So you think experts are mapping out asteroids too quickly.

784
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,430
一旦他们完成
If they finish,

785
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,020
政府发现在可预见的未来里地球都是安全的
and it turns out the world is safe for the foreseeable future,

786
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,590
就会中断他们的资金
the governments will cut off the funding.

787
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,720
这就给了这些执行总裁们
Which gets one or more of these CEO's

788
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,450
推迟研究的动机
motive to slow things down.

789
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,720
科尔的文章营造了不确定的气氛
Cole's paper creates a fog of uncertainty,

790
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,940
延长了人类对未知事物的恐惧
humanity's fear of the unknown is prolonged,

791
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,070
而他们得以搭乘恐惧的火箭
and they get to ride that rocket of terror

792
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,140
前往他们天空中的金矿
to their gold mine in the sky.

793
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,180
你说的没错
You're right.

794
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,900
那是在外太空  但确实说得通
It's out there. But it makes sense.

795
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,650
只要这些人不介意赌一把运气
As long as whoever it is doesn't mind rolling the dice.

796
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,390
如果我们在未来几年都被小行星从地球上抹去
If we're all wiped out by an asteroid in the next few years,

797
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,780
他们肯定会觉得相当可笑
they're gonna feel pretty silly.

798
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,020
我很确定他们确信这几率对他们有利
I'm certain that they're certain the odds are in their favor.

799
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,450
说到被蒙蔽
Oh, speaking of being blindsided,

800
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,060
我昨天和普罗斯基副局长见了个面
I had a meeting with Deputy Chief Prosky yesterday.

801
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,810
你已经知道这个小组嘉奖的事好几周了
You've known about the unit citation for weeks--

802
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,340
你怎么完全没提过
why didn't you say anything?

803
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,470
因为我知道你一定会反对
Well, because I knew you'd be against it.

804
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,030
所以你知道我会反对
So you knew I'd object...

805
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,440
但你还是密谋接受了荣誉委员会的询问
yet you conspired with the Honor Committee's inquiry nonetheless.

806
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,870
这就是我不跟你说的原因
And this is why I did not bring it up.

807
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,120
我想给你看点东西
I want to show you something.

808
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,790
我并没有密谋
I didn't conspire.

809
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,200
大约一周前荣誉委员会打电话过来
The Honor Committee called about a week ago.

810
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,720
你当时不在家  我去了普罗斯基的办公室
You weren't here. I went to Prosky's office,

811
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,180
回答了一些问题  就这样而已
answered some questions. That's it.

812
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,560
这是什么
What's this?

813
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,360
这是你的戒毒一年徽章
It's your one-year sobriety chip.

814
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,580
没错  那这个呢
Yeah, and what's this?

815
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,450
也是我的戒毒一年徽章
Also my one-year sobriety chip.

816
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,650
一个是我第一年的徽章
One is my first one-year chip,

817
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,250
另一个是我第二年的徽章
the other is my second one-year chip.

818
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,040
-所以呢  -它们没有任何区别
- So? - So they're indistinguishable.

819
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,310
这些奖项  这些绶带  这些饰品
These awards, these ribbons, trinkets,

820
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,290
它们只是象征而已  无关紧要
they're-they're just symbols; they don't matter.

821
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,520
没什么重要的
Not really.

822
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,500
我们所做的工作
The work we do does.

823
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,920
这些工作才是真正重要的
The work is all that matters.

824
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,910
如果这些象征对你来说意义如此之小
If symbols matter so little to you,

825
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,170
你为什么非要反对接受一份证书呢
why are you so against accepting a certificate?

826
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,860
格雷森警监想为我们做点什么
Captain Gregson wants to do something nice for us.

827
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,020
他同时也是我们的朋友
He's also our friend.

828
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,380
我很感激
I appreciate it.

829
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,430
我想让他这么做  这有什么不好呢
I'd like to let him. So where's the harm?

830
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,090
这就好比伸进帐篷里的骆驼鼻子  华生
It's the camel's nose in the tent, Watson.

831
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,560
-什么  -就是得寸进尺
- What? - It's a slippery slope.

832
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,480
我在苏格兰场的时候经历过
I saw it during my time at Scotland Yard.

833
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,250
我拒绝接受任何警方官方嘉奖的原因
The reason I refused to accept any official police credit

834
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,550
就是我一旦允许其发生了
is that once I allow it,

835
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,290
这事就没有个头了
there's no official line as to where it stops.

836
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,150
接着不久我就会开始让整个警局黯然失色
And then soon I begin to eclipse the whole department.

837
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,350
而由此引发的愤懑及其对合作关系
And-and resentment and its inevitable harm

838
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,450
所带来的不可避免的伤害很快就接踵而至
to working relationships quickly follows.

839
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,160
所以你不想接受任何嘉奖
So you don't want to accept any credit

840
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,570
是因为实际上你值得太多赞誉
because the truth is you deserve too much credit.

841
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,820
我们所做的工作太重要了不能被任何因素危及
The work we do is too important to jeopardize.

842
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,310
我放弃了  我去睡觉了
I give up. I'm going to bed.

843
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,840
我想你这不是给我带的枕边早餐
I assume that's not you bringing me breakfast in bed.

844
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,280
我本以为你或许需要一些补偿  我错了
I thought you might need some of my remedy-- I was wrong.

845
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,180
所以我睡觉的时候你给我做了毒藤检测吗
So you checked me for poison ivy in my sleep?

846
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,890
还真是一点都不变态呢
That is not creepy.

847
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,840
我并不需要看除你胳膊以外的其他部位
I had no need to look anywhere other than your arms.

848
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,310
你看起来未接触到毒素
You appear to have been unexposed.

849
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,460
我自己身上的皮疹则扩散了
My own rash, however, has spread.

850
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,410
你仍然确定你没碰到任何毒藤吗
You still sure you didn't touch any?

851
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,320
我确定
I am.

852
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,030
那你怎么会起皮疹的
Then how could you have a rash?

853
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,320
你昨晚睡了之后我继续进行了调查
I continued working after you went to bed last night,

854
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,360
仔细查看了四家小行星采矿公司的资料
poring over information on the four asteroid mining companies.

855
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,950
我相信我不仅确定了一位嫌疑人
I believe I've not only identified a suspect,

856
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,190
而且同时找到了我起皮疹的原因
but also the explanation for my rash.

857
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,580
我坚持认为我没有接触过毒常青藤
I maintain I did not come into contact with poison ivy--

858
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,930
但你和我已经见过杀害罗素·科尔的凶手了
but you and I have come into contact with Russell Cole's killer.

859
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,780
马库斯刚打电话来了
Marcus just called.

860
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,950
警方已经获准进行搜查
The police got permission to go ahead.

861
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,310
所以我们也该快点出发了
So we should head out soon.

862
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,210
我还收到了副局长办公室的消息
I also heard from the deputy chief's office.

863
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,410
他们把我们加入表彰日名单了
They're including us in Medal Day.

864
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,940
警监将代表整个小队参加典礼
The captain is gonna go on behalf of the squad,

865
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,210
然后他会把荣誉证书带回局里
and then he's gonna bring back the certificates

866
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,720
进行分发
to hand out at the station.

867
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,380
你会怎么做  华生
What would you do, Watson,

868
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,230
如果你知道世界末日即将在  比如说
if you knew the world was ending in, say,

869
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,740
一个月内来临
one month's time?

870
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,330
说来听听
Indulge me.

871
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,860
假设一颗直径32公里的小行星
An asteroid 20 miles wide

872
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,350
在我们说话这会正朝我们飞来
is hurtling towards us as we speak.

873
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,250
你昨晚已经表明了你的观点  好吗
You made your point last night, okay?

874
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,730
我们会一直工作到最后一刻
We would both continue doing our jobs to the very end.

875
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,530
我们做的工作很重要
The work we do is important.

876
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,570
我觉得我本该更好地解释
I think I could have done a better job

877
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,300
这为什么很重要
explaining why it's important.

878
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,480
至少向我自己解释这为什么很重要
At least explaining why it's important... to me.

879
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,990
我俩当初刚开始合作的时候
When you and I first started...

880
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,920
我很快就发现了你的优点
I quickly recognized your merits,

881
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,110
不仅是作为一位天生的侦探
both as a detective in your own right...

882
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,860
还有你对我工作过程的助益
and in that you facilitated my own process.

883
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,600
我因你的存在而得以更好地工作
I'm better at the work I do because of you.

884
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,250
但这么多年来
But over the years...

885
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,320
这两点价值相对的重要性翻转了
the relative importance of those two values has flipped.

886
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,170
我现在首要珍视的是我们所做的工作
I now value the work that we do, first and foremost,

887
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,390
因为这些工作是我们一起完成的
because I do it with you.

888
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,240
所以如果有时候我过于保护
So if at times I seem overprotective

889
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,820
我们所建立的这个合作体系
of the system that we've built,

890
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,850
如果我担心其他人的愤懑可能会对其产生影响
if I worry that the resentments of others might disrupt it...

891
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,920
我是有充分理由的
I have good reason.

892
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,340
你昨天晚上给我看的那些徽章
Those chips you showed me last night...

893
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,640
你并不是为了你自己而接受的
you don't accept them for yourself.

894
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,810
你接受它们是因为你是一个团体中的一员
You accept them because you're part of a group.

895
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,610
你接受它们是因为
You accept them because...

896
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,650
你在互助会上所做的一切鼓舞了其他人
the work you did to stand up at a meeting inspires others.

897
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,320
这远比你个人重要
It's bigger than you.

898
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,970
或者我们
Or us.

899
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,140
所以你在颁奖现场出现了
So you show up.

900
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,400
我去准备一下
I'm gonna go get ready.

901
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,160
有人在吗
Hello?

902
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,300
胡贝尔先生
Mr. Huber.

903
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,990
谢谢你过来
Thank you for coming.

904
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,310
福尔摩斯先生  华生女士
Mr. Holmes, Miss Watson.

905
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,610
我接到了朱利斯·肯特的电话
I got a call from Julius Kent.

906
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,590
你们也是来这里见他的吗
Are you meeting him here, too?

907
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,230
是我们让朱利斯邀请你来的
We asked Julius to invite you here.

908
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,710
我们已经见识了他的影响力
We'd seen how much influence he has,

909
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,940
所以我们知道你一定会来
so we knew you'd come.

910
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,180
这样警方就能去搜查你的办公室了
It's so police could search your office,

911
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,060
当然  是议员女士萨拉查批准的
with Congresswoman Salazar's permission, of course.

912
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,600
警察为什么要搜查我的办公室
Why do the police want to search my office?

913
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,670
怎么不直接跟我说  我会同意的
Why not just ask? I'd have let them.

914
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,670
你很自信  觉得没什么可怕的
You're confident you have nothing to fear because you think

915
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,120
因为你觉得没有证据能证明杀了你罗素·科尔
there's no evidence there of you having murdered Russell Cole.

916
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,260
你错了
You are wrong.

917
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,650
你们觉得我杀了罗素·科尔
You think I killed Russell Cole?

918
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,780
是的
We do.

919
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,600
就在你们一起写了那篇文章后
After the two of you wrote that paper together.

920
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,750
简直胡扯
That makes no sense.

921
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,130
我有什么理由
What possible reason would I have

922
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,670
要破坏我帮忙一起赚来的资金
to sabotage the funding I helped get?

923
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,940
你说的是探索小行星的资金
You're referring to the funding for asteroid hunting.

924
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,510
然而  我们把注意力
As it happens, we've shifted our focus

925
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,530
更多地转向了开采小行星
more towards asteroid mining.

926
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,560
在调查涉事公司的时候
While looking into the companies involved in that,

927
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,480
一个熟悉的名字一直跳出来
a familiar name kept recurring.

928
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,800
在你跟着萨拉查女士开始现在这份工作前
Prior to your current job with Ms. Salazar,

929
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,830
你是个与那些公司有着深厚联系的说客
you were a lobbyist with deep ties to those companies.

930
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,210
我们相信就是在那时候
We believe it was in that capacity

931
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,260
你第一次见到了科尔先生
that you first met Mr. Cole.

932
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,960
他对你的一名客户做了分析
He conducted an analysis of one of your clients.

933
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,590
他的日程表显示你们曾多次
His calendar showed a number of dinner dates

934
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,710
共进晚餐
between the two of you.

935
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,710
你还帮忙通过了立法
You also helped get legislation passed

936
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,440
让那些公司有权去开采小行星
giving those companies the right to mine asteroids.

937
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,430
据你的社交媒体照片显示
And based on your social media photos,

938
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,980
你为一名公务员花了大把的钱
you spend way too much money for a public servant.

939
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,910
这表明你的前雇主在花钱让你
Which indicates that your former employers are paying you

940
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,850
确保政府决策会按照他的意思来
to make sure that government decisions go their way.

941
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,930
而最近  要确保如此就包括了
And most recently, that included you

942
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,610
得杀死罗素·科尔
killing Russell Cole.

943
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,120
你们都疯了
You people are crazy.

944
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,260
你们有哪怕一丝证据能证明这些吗
Do you have even a shred of proof to support any of this?

945
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,890
所以才有了现在正在进行的对你办公室的搜查
That brings us to the search currently underway at your office.

946
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,420
犯罪后的某个时间
At some point after the crime,

947
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
你把罗素·科尔的笔记本电脑带了过去
you brought Russell Cole's laptop there.

948
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,030
外壳上沾了漆酚
The case was covered in urushiol.

949
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,370
是来自有毒的常春藤叶中的一种油
It's the oil which comes from poison ivy leaves.

950
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,360
你绝对想不到那种油从一个地方
You'd be surprised at how easily that oil transfers

951
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,480
沾到另一个地方有多容易
from one surface to another.

952
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,670
比如  你把电脑放在了你的沙发上
For example, you put the case on your couch.

953
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,990
我坐了沙发  我的皮肤就有了中毒反应
I sat there, and my skin reacted to the toxins.

954
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,660
我不知道你在说什么
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

955
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,480
我没有有毒的常春藤
I don't have poison ivy.

956
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,630
假设是真的
Assuming that's true,

957
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,150
有可能你属于那20%
it is possible that you are in the 20% of people

958
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,920
对它不敏感的人群
who are not sensitive to it.

959
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,240
不管怎样  警方正把你的沙发送去实验室
Either way, police are taking your couch to the lab

960
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,650
采集油渍样本
to collect oil samples.

961
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,170
他们还会拿着你的照片
They're also showing your photograph

962
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,210
去新城的一家餐厅找目击证人
around a diner in New City.

963
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,900
我觉得你被认出来只是时间问题
I think it's only a matter of time before you're recognized.

964
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,370
如果你想合作
If you want to cooperate,

965
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,570
并说出雇你去勾结科尔的人的名字
and share the names of the people who hired you

966
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,900
现在就是你的机会
to conspire with Cole, now is your chance.

967
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,170
以防你不知道
In case you're wondering,

968
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,140
漆酚里会有DNA
urushiol contains DNA.

969
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,820
所以要确认你沙发上的油
So a definitive match between the oil on your couch

970
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,300
和科尔的小屋那边的植物绝对吻合
and the plants at Cole's cabin

971
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,700
是完全可行的
will be attainable.

972
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,490
应该说是有可能
I should say, might be.

973
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,200
我不知道概率有多大  不过
I'm not sure of the odds, but...

974
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,720
我觉得会比小行星出现
I think they're better than an asteroid showing up

975
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,150
将你拉出困局的可能性大
to put you out of your misery.

976
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,900
我当警察三十多年了
I've been a cop more than 30 years now.

977
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,360
我目睹过这个城市的起起落落
I've seen this city go through its share of ups and down.

978
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,260
犯罪率起起伏伏
Crime rates rise and fall.

979
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,420
人际关系时好时坏
People get along or they don't.

980
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,320
近来  你看新闻的时候就会觉得
These days, you watch the news and it can feel like

981
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,530
一切都在分崩离析
everything's falling apart.

982
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,960
我说的不只是这里
And I don't mean just here.

983
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,980
到处都在发生不好的事
Bad stuff happening all over--

984
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,580
时常有警察被杀
cops getting killed.

985
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,740
有时候早上起床都会是种挣扎
Makes it tough some mornings to want to get out of bed.

986
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,550
然而坏人却没有休息的时候
Not that the bad guys will ever take a day off.

987
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,780
我说这些不是想让大家觉得丧气
Now I don't say all this to bring everybody down,

988
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,330
我说这些是想让你们知道
I say all this because I want you to know

989
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,860
是什么让我早上有起床的动力
what gets me out of bed in the morning.

990
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,280
是什么让我每天回来这里
What gets me back here, at work,

991
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,650
做我的工作
doing the job, every day.

992
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,000
是你们
You guys do.

993
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,410
你们所有人
All of you.

994
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,180
这个小队的成员都是人中龙凤
This squad is the finest group of men and women

995
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,710
我无比有幸才能跟你们共事
I've ever had the honor to serve with.

996
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,880
这不只是恭维
And that's not just a line.

997
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,620
而是我们的破案率显示的结果
It's what our clearance rate says.

998
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,820
所以你们今天能受到认可
That's why it was important for me

999
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,490
对我来说非常重要
that you all got recognized today.

1000
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,560
因为你们所做的无与伦比的工作
Because the extraordinary work you do,

1001
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,590
日复一日
day in, day out, it...

1002
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,330
让我钦佩
it amazes me.

1003
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
这个团队  这个大家庭
This team, this family--

1004
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,260
你们是我前进的动力
you guys are what keep me going.

1005
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,700
所以  帮我个忙好吗
So, do me a favor, would you?

1006
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,500
给你们自己鼓掌喝彩吧
Give yourselves a hand?
